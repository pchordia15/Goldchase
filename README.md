# Goldchase

Goldchase Game

The game of Goldchase involves 1-5 players moving around the map searching for gold. The map shows many potential locations for the gold, but only one location contains gold. The other locations contain fool's gold. To win the game, we need to find the real gold and make it to the edge of the map. The project is developed in three stages.

### Project Stages ###

* 1. Initial project developed using shared memory and semaphores to coordinate multiple process.
* 2. Additional features such as automatic screen updates and messages between players are added to the Stage 1.
* 3. Enhancement of Stage 2, where we add support for sockets so players on other computers can connect to a running game.
